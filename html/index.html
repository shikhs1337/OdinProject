                        The inextinguishable flames are the inherent technique of the Uchiha clan that only the Mangekyou users can wield.
                        Amaterasu is said to be hot as the sun and can only be extinguished if the target burns down completely or the castor dies.

                        This Jutsu is Itachi's innate ability and is said to be one of the highest levels of Jutsu in the entire series.
                        This ability allows him to control space and time inside of his Genjutsu.

                        Susano is a giant humanoid form of chakra that the user can summon to fight on their behalf.
                        The form and color of the Susano are unique to a person and Itachi's was a beautiful shade of red.

                    <div>
                        Izanami is a forbidden Jutsu of the Uchiha clan since it claims the user's eyesight at a single use. However, the power it possesses is immense.
                        It allows the user to create an illusion of a never-ending loop to trap their target for eternity.

            <p>People live their lives bound by what they accept as correct and true. That's how they define "reality". But what does it mean to be "correct" or "true"?
                Merely vague concepts... Their "reality" may all be a mirage. Can we consider them to simply be living in their own world, shaped by their beliefs?</p>
